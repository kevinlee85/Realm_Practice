# Realm_Practice
Ray Wenderlish provided a very excellent Tutorial(http://www.raywenderlich.com/81615/introduction-to-realm) about Realm based on Swift language. Although Realm released new swift version library(RealmSwift.framework). So the tutorial is a little out of date. Then i released the updated codes for your reference.
